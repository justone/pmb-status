# pmb-status

Set various statuses via [PMB](http://pmb.io).

The idea would be to set a few status type things from one place.

* One or more [Slack](https://slack.com/) instances.
* [Blink(1)](https://blink1.thingm.com/) notification light.

Why? Because I want to be able to shut off all the distractions as politely and
quickly as possible.
